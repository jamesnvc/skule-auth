This is the authentication backend that will be used by the Skule student website

To run this on your own server, simply install Twisted, then run
"rpc_auth_server.py".  Included in the "testing" directory is a sample of the
usage of this system.

Note that to use SSL, you will also have to generate SSL certs, change the
paths to them in "rpc_auth_server", and configure Apache and mod_ssl
appropriately.
