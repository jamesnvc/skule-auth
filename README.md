This is the authentication backend that will be used by the Skule student website

To run this on your own server, simply install Twisted, then run
`rpc\_auth\_server.py`.  Included in the `testing` directory is a sample of the
usage of this system.

Note that to use SSL, you will also have to generate SSL certs, change the
paths to them in `rpc\_auth\_server`, and configure Apache and mod_ssl
appropriately.

Generating SSL Certs
--------------------

<pre>
$ openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024
$ openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr
$ cp server.key server.key.org
$ openssl rsa -in server.key.org -out server.key
$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
</pre>

Then, you'll want to notify Apache of this:  

<pre>
$ cp server.crt /etc/apache2/server.crt
$ cp server.key /etc/apache2/server.key
</pre>

and add lines to your Apache configuration, probably something along the line of

<pre>
SSLCertificateFile "/etc/apache2/server.crt"
SSLCertificateKeyFile "/etc/apache2/server.key"
</pre>

as well as installing and activating `mod_ssl`

Generating the database
--------------------

The database used in the sample code is a SQLite database for ease of testing.
To create the database, simply run the following code:

<pre>
sqlite3 test.db < testing.sql
</pre>

which will create a database named "test.db" containing the user tables.
